				<section>
					<h2>History of Waterfall Model</h2>
					<ul>
						<li><u>Winston W. Royce</u> 1970 article, "Managing the Development of Large Software Systems" introduced the description of the waterfall model.</li>
						<ul>
							<li>The article contained many of his personal views on software development.</li>
						</ul>
						<li>Royce did not use the term "waterfall" in the article.</li>
						<li>Royce presented the model as an example of a flawed, non-working model.</li>
					</ul>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h2>Why Flawed Model?</h2>
					<ul>
						<li>Illustrates the software development in a linear sequential flow.</li>
						<li>One phase acts as the input for the next phase sequentially.</li>
						<ul>
							<li>Any phase in the development process begins only if the previous phase is complete.</li>
							<li>The phases do not overlap</li>
							<li>Therefore it is difficult to go back to phases and change flaws.</li>
						</ul>
						<li>Royce believed that a successful model should have the allowance to repetition or go back and forth between phases.</li>
					</ul>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h2>Why It Is Still Used</h2>
					<ul>
						<li>Scientific articles that discuss the Waterfall model all cite Royce's article</li>
							<ul>
							    <li>Articles often use phrasing like: "The waterfall is a proven method (Royce, 1970)"</li>
						    </ul>
						<li>Unfortunately this is how science works</li>
							<ul>
							    <li>Reserchers cite based on "buzz" or popularity from other researchers</li>
							    <li>They don't read the publications but go off of second-hand research</li>
						    </ul>
						<li>Nonetheless, the Waterfall method was widely used in Software Engineering and is still used today though often in modified models</li>
					</ul>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h2>Waterfall Model</h2>
					<img height="518" src="images/original_waterfall_model.png">
				</section>	

				<section>
					<h2>Definition</h2>
					<p>The waterfall model is:</p>
					<p>"A sequential design process, used in software development process, in which progress is seen as flowing steadily downwards (like a waterfall) through the phases of conception, initiation, analysis, design, construction, testing, production/implementation and maintenance"</p>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h2>Features of Waterfall Model</h2>
					<ul>
						<li>It is simple to understand and use.</li>
						<li>It can be implemented for projects of varying size and scope.</li>
						<li>Each stage has to be done separately and sequentially.</li>
						<ul>
							<li>Each stage must be completed before the next phase can begin.</li>
							<li>The phases do not overlap.</li>
						</ul>
						<li>Documentation is produced at every stage allowing people to understand what has been done.</li>
						<li>Testing is done at every stage.</li>
					</ul>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h2>Phases of Waterfall Model</h2>
					<p>The waterfall model has 6 different phases:</p>
					<ol>
						<li>Requirement Gathering and Analysis</li>
						<li>Design</li>
						<li>Coding (Implementation)</li>
						<li>Testing</li>
						<li>Deployment</li>
						<li>Maintenance</li>
					</ol>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h2>Phase 1: Requirement Gathering and Anlaysis</h2>
					<img height="518" src="images/phase1.png">
				</section>	

				<section>
					<h2>Phase 1: Requirement Gathering and Analysis</h2>
					<ul>
						<li>This phase includes a meeting with the customer to understand the user requirements and creating a product requirements document (Requirements Understanding Document)</li>
						<ul>
						<li>Research Conducted:</li>
							<ul>
								<li>Brainstorm and walkthrough to better understand the requirements</li>
								<li>Requirements feasibility test</li>
								<li>What is the software goiog to be</li>
								<li>Purpose it will fullfill</li>
							</ul>
						</ul>
					</ul>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h2>Phase 1: Con't</h2>
					<ul>
						<li><strong><font color="red">This is the most crucial phase as any misinterpretation at this stage may give rise to validation issues later.</font></strong></li>
						<li>The software definition must be detailed and accurate with no ambiguities.</li>
						<li>It is very important to understand the customer requirements and exprectations so that the end product meet his/her specifications.</li>
						<li>The basic requirements of the system must be understoond by software engineer.</li>
						<li>All requirements are well documented and discuessed further with the customer for reviewing.</li>
					</ul>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h2>Phase 2: System Design</h2>
					<img height="518" src="images/phase2.png">
				</section>	

				<section>
					<h2>Phase 2: System Design</h2>
					<ul>
						<li>Requirement specifications from Phase 1 are studied.</li>
						<li>Customer requirements are broken down into logical modules.</li>
							<ul>
								<li>Helps in specifying hardware and system requirements</li>
								<li>Helps in defining overall system architecture</li>
							</ul>
						<li>Relationship between the various logical modules are established.</li>
						<ul>
							<li>Algorithms, diagrams, and functions are decided/developed</li>
							<li>Engineering units are placed (i.e. modules, programs, etc)</li>
						</ul>
					</ul>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h2>Phase 2: Con't</h2>
					<ul>
						<li>Requirements are translated so coding can be done effectively and efficiently.</li>
						<li>Designing needs to be documented for further use.</li>
						<li>This phase lays a fundamental for actual programming and implementation.</li>
						<li>Create High Level Design Document (HLD) and Low Level Design Document (LLD)</li>
					</ul>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h2>Phase 3: Implementation</h2>
					<img height="518" src="images/phase3.png">
				</section>	

				<section>
					<h2>Phase 3: Implementation</h2>
					<ul>
						<li>With inputs from Phase 2, the system is first developed in units.</li>
						<ul>
							<li>Software is divided into small modules for coding rather than coding the whole software.</li>
							<li>Source code is written.</li>
						</ul>
						<li>Design is translated into machine readable format.</li>
						<li>Programs are created in this phase.</li>
						<li>Unit Testing: Each unit is developed and tested for its functionality.</li>
					</ul>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h2>Phase 4: Testing</h2>
					<img height="518" src="images/phase4.jpg">
				</section>	

				<section>
					<h2>Phase 4: Testing</h2>
					<ul>
						<li>Units developed in the Phase 3 are integrated into a system after testing each individual unit.</li>
						<ul>
							<li>Ensure error-free by testing and fully meeting the requirements outlined in Phase 1.</li>
						</ul>
						<li>Post integration the entire system is tested for any faults and failures.</li>
						<li>Tesing is done in two parts:</li>
						<ol>
							<li>Hardware</li>
							<li>Software</li>
						</ol>
					</ul>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h2>Phase 4: Con't</h2>
					<ul>
						<li>Whole design and its construction is put under a test to check its functionality.</li>
						<ul>
							<li>Any errors will surface at this point of the process</li>
						</ul>
						<li>Materials produced in this phase:</li>
						<ul>
							<li>Test cases</li>
							<li>Test reports</li>
							<li>Defect reports</li>
							<li>Updated matrices</li>
						</ul>
					</ul>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h2>Phase 5: Deployment</h2>
					<img height="518" src="images/phase5.png">
				</section>	

				<section>
					<h2>Phase 5: Deployment</h2>
					<ul>
						<li>Once the functional and non functional testing is done, the product is deployed in the customer environment or released into the market.</li>
						<li>In order to deploy the system the engineers need to make sure:</li>
						<ul>
							<li>Deploy the application in the respective environment.</li>
							<li>That there are no severe defects open.</li>
							<li>Make sure that the test exit criteria are met.</li>
							<li>Perform a sanity check in the environment after the application is deployed to ensure the application does not break.</li>
						</ul>
					<li>The User Manual is also produced at this time.</li>
					</ul>
				</section>
				
				<section>
					<h2>Phase 6: Maintenance</h2>
					<img height="518" src="images/phase6.jpg">
				</section>	

				<section>
					<h2>Phase 6: Maintenance</h2>
					<ul>
						<li>Software development team undertake routine maintenace activities by visting the client site.</li>
						<li>If enhancements or changes are needed, the software process has to be followed all over again.</li>
						<ul>
							<li>How issues can be fixed</li>
							<ul>
								<li>Patches are released to fix issues</li>
								<li>Better versions are released to enhace the product</li>
							</ul>
						</ul>
					</ul>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h2>Phase 6: Con't</h2>
					<ul>
						<li>This is usually the longest stage of the software.</li>
						<li>Software is updated to:</li>
						<ol>
							<li>Meet the changing customer needs</li>
							<li>Adapted to accommodate changes in the external environment</li>
							<li>Correct errors</li>
							<li>Enhance the efficiency of the software</li>
						</ol>
					</ul>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h2>Advantages of Waterfall</h2>
					<ul>
						<li>Easy to understand and use.</li>
						<li>Allows for departmentalization and control.</li>
						<li>The fulfillment of one phase is needed before proceeding to the next.</li>
						<ul>
							<li>Each phase has specific deliverables and review process.</li>
							<li>Design errors are captured before any software is written, saving time during the implementation phase.</li>
						</ul>
					</ul>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h2>Advantages Con't</h2>
					<ul>
						<li>Each phase of development proceeds in a strict order.</li>
							<ul>
								<li>Phases are processed and completed one at a time.</li>
							</ul>
						<li>Works well for smaller projects where requirements, budget and scope are very well understood.</li>
						<li>Easy to arrange tasks.</li>
						<li>Process and results are well documented.</li>
					</ul>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h2>Disadvantages of Waterfall</h2>
					<ul>
						<li>Requirement analysis is done initially.</li>
						<ul>
							<li>Sometimes it is not possible to state all the requirement at the beginning.</li>
							<li>There are high amounts of risk and uncertainty.</li>
						</ul>
						<li>Customer can see working model only at the end.</li>
						<li>Poor model for long, ongoing projects where there is no set timeline.</li>
					</ul>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h2>Disadvantages Con't</h2>
					<ul>
						<li>Not possible to backtrack since the phases flow from one to another.</li>
						<ul>
							<li>Does not allow much for reflection or revision.</li>
							<li>Once in the testing phase, it is very difficult to go back and change something.</li>
						</ul>
						<li>Not a good model for complex projects.</li>
						<ul>
							<li>Not good for project where requirements are at high risk of changing.</li>
						</ul>
					</ul>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h2>Example of Waterfall Model Used: 
						<br>Product Development – Developing a Customer Address Book</h2>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h2>Product Requirements</h2>
					<ul>
						<li>Product manager creates requirement documents that include the following requirements (in order of priority).</li>
							<ul>
								<li>User should be able to create new contacts.</li>
								<li>User should be able to view their contacts.</li>
								<li>User should be able to import contacts from other programs.</li>
								<li>User should be able to email their contacts from the address book.</li>
								<li>User should be able to add pictures to represent their contacts.</li>
							</ul>
					</ul>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h2>Product Requirements Con't</h2>
						<ul>
							<li>These requirement documents will include details requirements, user scenarios and potential layouts for the functionality.</li>
							<li>Timeframe: 2 weeks</li>
						</ul>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h2>Analysis</h2>
					<ul>
						<li>Engineering team takes these requirements and analyzes them, asking questions as needed.</li>
						<li>Product manager updates the documents as questions are resolved.</li>
						<li>Timeframe: 1 week</li>
					</ul>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h2>Design</h2>
					<ul>
						<li>Engineering team creates a design for functionality, including database design, mock-ups and workflows</li>
						<li>Timeframe: 3 weeks</li>
					</ul>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h2>Implementation</h2>
					<ul>
						<li>Engineering team develps functionality and prepares it for testing</li>
						<li>Timeframe: 1 week</li>
					</ul>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h2>Software Product Testing</h2>
					<ul>
						<li>Product team tests the entire functionality.</li>
						<li>Timeframe: 2 weeks</li>
					</ul>
				</section>	

				<section>
					<h2>Deployment</h2>
					<ul>
						<li>Team delivers the product to the client</li>
						<li>Timeframe: 1 week</li>
					</ul>
				</section>	

				<section>
					<h2>Maintenance</h2>
					<ul>
						<li>Product team checks in with client, makes appropriate and necessary changes and fixes, and helps keep the program running</li>
						<li>Timeframe: Indefinite</li>
						<li><strong><font color="red">Note: If any changes to the design occurs during this workflow, the project would have to return to the second or third phase and restart the process.</font></strong></li>
					</ul>
				</section>	

				<section>
					<h2>Importance to Software Engineering</h2>
					<ul>
						<li>The waterfall method offers numberous advantages for software developers.</li>
						<ul>
							<li>Staged development cycle enforces discipline.</li>
							<li>Progress can be identified by the developer and client.</li>
							<li>Emphasis on requirements and design before coding.</li>
							<ul>
								<li>Ensure minimal wastage of time and effort.</li>
								<li>Reduce risk of customer expectations not being met.</li>
							</ul>
							<li>Can catch and correct flaws at the design stage rather at the testing stage.</li
						</ul>
					</ul>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h2>Additional Materials</h2>
					<ul>
						<li><a href="documents/royce_waterfall.pdf">Dr. Winston Royce original paper on the waterfall method</a></li>
						<li>New models has been created by modifying the waterfall model</li>
						<ul>
							<li>Sashimi Model</li>
							<li>Aorta Lifecycle Model</li>
							<li>V Waterfall Model</li>
						</ul>
					</ul>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h2>Fun Fact: Sashimi Model</h2>
					<img height="400" src="images/sashimi.png">
				</section>

				<section>
					<h2>Sashimi Model</h2>
					<ul>
						<li>The sashimi model was originated by Peter DeGrace.</li>
						<li>It got its name because it features overlapping phases, like the overlapping fish of Japanese sashimi</li>
						<center><img height="400" src="images/sashimi_fish.jpg"></center>
					</ul>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h2>Sashimi Model Con't</h2>
					<ul>
						<li>Sometimes it is referred to as "the waterfall model with feedback."</li>
						<center><img height="400" src="images/waterfall_feedback.png"></center>
						</ul>
					</ul>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h2>Sashimi Model Con't</h2>
					<ul>
						<li>Similar to the waterfall, except that the phases overlap to show that requirements cannot be completed until the architecture is <u>at least partially explored.</u></li>
						<ul>
							<li>One can return to the previous step if desired.</li>
						</ul>
						<li>Another important feature of the sashimi model is the different treatment of the documentation.</li>
						<ul>
							<li>The model treats the documentation as unified documents</li>
							<li>This results in a significant reduction in the documentation volume.</li>
						</ul>
					</ul>

http.createServer(&lt;function&gt;).listen(1337, '127.0.0.1');
					</code></pre>
          <ul>
						<li><strong>http</strong> provides a function called <strong>createServer()</strong></li>
						<li>It takes a function that implements the server's behavior</li>
						<li><strong>createServer()</strong> returns an object with a method <strong>listen()</strong>
              <ul>
                <li>It accepts the server's network interface and port</li>
                <li>It also starts the server running</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
          </ul>

  res.end('Hello World\n');
}
					</code></pre>
					<ul>
						<li>This is the <em>anonymous</em> function passed to <strong>createServer()</strong>.</li>
						<li>Each time the server receives a request
							<ul>
								<li>It invokes this function and passes the HTTP request and response objects</li>
							</ul>
						</li>
						<li>This particular function ignores all input and generates a simple HTTP response.</li>
					</ul>
				</section>

					<ul>
						<li><strong>console.log()</strong> is the <strong>printf()</strong> of the Javascript world.</li>
					</ul>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h2>Explanation (5)</h2>
					<p>Our program in abstract form</p>
					<pre><code data-trim contenteditable>
1. Get the http module.
2. Create a server; register a function; start a server.
3. Print out a message.
					</code></pre>
					<ul>
						<li>All of this is executed immediately when passed to <strong>node</strong></li>
						<li>If no future work remained, <strong>node</strong> would shut down.</li>
						<li>This particular program, however, will run forever
							<ul>
								<li>because the HTTP server has set up an event to check for new requests on every cycle of the event loop</li>
						</li>
					</ul>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h2>Event Loop?</h2>
					<ul>
						<li>In order to understand Node.js, you need to understand the <em>event loop</em></li>
						<li>Event-based programming is a programming style where the code you write is not in control
							<ul>
								<li>Instead, you write code that says (essentially)<br>"When event x happens, do this"</li>
							</ul>
						</li>
					</ul>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h2>Event Loop (1)</h2>
					<p>The basic structure of all Node.js programs</p>
					<pre><code data-trim contenteditable>
while (there are events to be handled) {
	handle event
}
					</code></pre>
					<p>This is how GUI programs are written.</p>
					<p>"If user click here, do this."</p>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h2>Event Loop (2)</h2>
					<ul>
						<li>Node tries to make it easy to <a href="http://nodejs.org/api/timers.html">add work to the event queue</a></li>
						<li>Libraries like <strong>http</strong> take functions and add them to the queue on your behalf (as we saw with <strong>createServer()</strong>).</li>
						<li>Node also lets you add functions to the event queue for later execution.
							<ul>
								<li>process.nextTick()</li>
								<li>setImmediate()</li>
								<li>setTimeout()</li>
								<li>setInterval()</li>
							</ul>
						</li>
					</ul>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h2>Event Loop (3) &mdash; process.nextTick()</h2>
					<p>A simple example using process.nextTick()</p>
					<pre><code data-trim contenteditable>
console.log("first!");
process.nextTick(function() {
  console.log("third!");
});
console.log("second!");
					</code></pre>
					<ul>
						<li>Our main program is simply a function passed to the event loop</li>
						<li>On the first pass: log(), nextTick(), log()</li>
						<li>On the second pass: log()</li>
						<li>Since there are no more events, the program ends.</li>
					<ul>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h2>Event Loop (4)</h2>
					<ul>
						<li>Our program would behave the same if you replaced process.nextTick() with setImmediate()</li>
						<li>They both schedule a function for the next iteration of the event loop.
							<ul>
								<li>The difference is that setImmediate() allows IO-related callbacks to process first.</li>

					<h2>Event Loop (5)</h2>
					<ul>
						<li>setTimeout() takes a second parameter that specifies how long to wait before the function is executed.</li>
						<li>setInterval() take a second parameter that specifies the interval at which this function should be executed.
							<ul>
								<li>If the interval is never turned off, the node program will execute "forever".</li>

					<h2>Callback Hell (1)</h2>
					<p>Callbacks are great for asynchronous programming, but...</p>
					<p>It can lead to <em>callback hell</em>, where callbacks get indented</p>

					<h2>Callback Hell (3)</h2>
					<ul>
						<li>The problem occurs when you have to chain multiple asynchronous calls together</li>
						<li>Each call in the chain has to be in a callback on the previous function
							<ul>
								<li>because you have to wait for the previous call to finish</li>
								<li>before you proceed</li>
							</ul>
						</li>
					</ul>

				<section>
					<h2>Callback Hell (4)</h2>
					<ul>
						<li>Two ways to solve this problem:
							<ul>
								<li>Use synchronous functions instead
									<ul>
										<li>frowned upon by the Node community</li>
									</ul>
								</li>
								<li>Use named callback functions
									<ul>
										<li>Define your functions individually</li>
										<li>Then refer to them by name in the code that requires a callback</li>
									</ul>
								</li>

					<h2>Just Callbacks?</h2>

						<li>Are callbacks the only asynchronous mechanism in Node?</li>
						<li>No!

					<h2>Node Execution Model (1)</h2>
					<ul>
						<li>For user-written code, Node is single threaded!</li>
						<li>Any code that you write is guaranteed to be synchronous</li>
						<li>You do not have to worry about race conditions</li>
						<li>IO is handled in parallel.</li>
					</ul>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h2>Node Execution Model (2)</h2>
					<ul>
						<li>If you issue an asyncrhonous call for IO
							<ul>
								<li>Your callback is registered</li>
								<li>The IO call is executed in a separate thread
									<ul>
										<li>Since it's an IO call, it immediately blocks</li>
									</ul>
								</li>
								<li>Other events on the event loop are handled as normal</li>
								<li>At some point, the IO completes and your callback is invoked
									<ul>
										<li>Invoked via setImmediate() or process.nextTick()</li>
										<li>So, even then, your code executes in a single thread</li>
									</ul>
								</li>
							</ul>

					<h2>Node Execution Model (3)</h2>
					<ul>
						<li>This model makes it very easy to implement services that run server-side.</li>
						<li>You are guaranteed that only one method of your service is running at any one time.</li>
						<li>You are now in a position to understand the Javascript implementation of the Contacts web service</li>
