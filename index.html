					<h2>History of Waterfall Model</h2>
					<ul>
						<li><u>Winston W. Royce</u> 1970 article, "Managing the Development of Large Software Systems" introduced the description of the waterfall model.</li>
						<ul>
							<li>The article contained many of his personal views on software development.</li>
						</ul>
						<li>Royce did not use the term "waterfall" in the article.</li>
						<li>Royce presented the model as an example of a flawed, non-working model.</li>
					</ul>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h2>Winston W. Royce (1929-1995)</h2>
					<ul>
						<li>Computer scientist with Lockheed Software Technology Center</li>
						<li>Pioneer in the field of software engineering</li>
						<li>He was involved in the research and development of several large and complex software systems, and started developing new methodologies for improving the management of software projec</li>
						<li>His influential article "Managing the Development of Large Software Systems" presented several project management models, including concepts that we now accredit to waterfall, iterative, and agile life cycles. </li>
					</ul>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h2>Royce Did Not Endorse the Waterfall Model</h2>
					<ul>
						<li>Royce is mistakenly accredited with the waterfall method</li>
						<li>Royce described the method that is now known as waterfall and said:</li>
						<ul>
							<li>“I believe in this concept, but the implementation described above is risky and invites failure.”</li>
						</ul>
						<li>He identified the pattern and showed one of the major problems of the Waterfall model as the testing phase occurs at the end of the development process.</li>
						<ul>
							<li>“Either the requirements must be modified, or a substantial change in the design is required.”</li>
						</ul>
					</ul>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h2>Royce's Recommendations</h2>
					<ul>
						<li>Royce proposed a more incremental development, where every next step links back to the step before.</li>
						<li>Not the agile method but had a few ideas that were agile and seemed to move in that direction</li>
						<li>Royce suggested 5 changes to the current (waterfall) method</li>
							<ol>
								<li>Program design comes first</li>
								<li>Document the design</li>
								<li>Do it twice</li>
								<li>Plan, control and monitor testing</li>
								<li>Involve the customer</li>
							</ol>
					</ul>
				</section>
					
				<section>
					<h2>How did Royce's message get lost?</h2>
					<ul>
						<li>Urban legend has it that an employee of the Department of Defense was charged with finding a new software development process.</li>
						<li>He only read the first page of Royce’s paper and saw the figure at the top of page 2 that looked like a waterfall.</li>
						<li>Without reading the rest of the paper this DoD employee proposed the model, as it was simple and easy to follow thus creating the Waterfall model.</li>
							<ul>
								<li>Since this employee did not read the whole article, they never read about Royce’s ideas to fix this deficient method. </li>
							</ul>
					</ul>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h2>Why Is Waterfall Flawed?</h2>
					<ul>
						<li>Illustrates the software development in a linear sequential flow.</li>
						<li>One phase acts as the input for the next phase sequentially.</li>
						<ul>
							<li>Any phase in the development process begins only if the previous phase is complete.</li>
							<li>The phases do not overlap</li>
							<li>Therefore it is difficult to go back to phases and change flaws.</li>
						</ul>
						<li>Royce believed that a successful model should have the allowance to repetition or go back and forth between phases.</li>
					</ul>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h2>Why It Is Still Used</h2>
					<ul>
						<li>History of working in state and defense projects.</li>
						<li>Scientific articles that discuss the Waterfall model all cite Royce's article</li>
							<ul>
							    <li>Articles often use phrasing like: "The waterfall is a proven method (Royce, 1970)"</li>
						    </ul>
						<li>Unfortunately this is how science works</li>
							<ul>
							    <li>Researchers cite based on "buzz" or popularity from other researchers and don't read the publications but go off of second-hand research</li>
						    </ul>
						<li>Nonetheless, the Waterfall method was widely used in Software Engineering and is still used today though often in modified models</li>
					</ul>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h2>Waterfall Model</h2>
					<img height="518" src="images/waterfall_model_phases.jpg">
				</section>	

				<section>
					<h2>Definition</h2>
					<p>The waterfall model is:</p>
					<p>"A sequential design process, used in software development process, in which progress is seen as flowing steadily downwards (like a waterfall) through the phases of conception, initiation, analysis, design, construction, testing, production/implementation and maintenance"</p>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h2>Features of Waterfall Model</h2>
					<ul>
						<li>It is simple to understand and use.</li>
						<li>It can be implemented for projects of varying size and scope.</li>
						<li>Each stage has to be done separately and sequentially.</li>
						<ul>
							<li>Each stage must be completed before the next phase can begin.</li>
							<li>The phases do not overlap.</li>
						</ul>
						<li>Documentation is produced at every stage allowing people to understand what has been done.</li>
						<li>Testing is done at every stage.</li>
					</ul>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h2>Phases of Waterfall Model</h2>
					<p>The waterfall model has 6 different phases:</p>
					<ol>
						<li>Requirement Gathering and Analysis</li>
						<li>Design</li>
						<li>Coding (Implementation)</li>
						<li>Testing</li>
						<li>Deployment</li>
						<li>Maintenance</li>
					</ol>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h2>Phase 1: Requirement Gathering and Analysis</h2>
					<img height="400" src="images/phase1.png">
				</section>	

				<section>
					<h2>Phase 1: Requirement Gathering and Analysis</h2>
					<ul>
						<li>This phase includes a meeting with the customer to understand the user requirements and creating a product requirements document (Requirements Understanding Document)</li>
						<ul>
						<li>Research Conducted:</li>
							<ul>
								<li>Brainstorm and walkthrough to better understand the requirements</li>
								<li>Requirements feasibility test</li>
								<li>What is the software going to be</li>
								<li>Purpose it will fulfill</li>
							</ul>
						</ul>
					</ul>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h2>Phase 1: Con't</h2>
					<ul>
						<li><strong><font color="red">This is the most crucial phase as any misinterpretation at this stage may give rise to validation issues later.</font></strong></li>
						<li>The software definition must be detailed and accurate with no ambiguities.</li>
						<li>It is very important to understand the customer requirements and expectations so that the end product meets his/her specifications.</li>
						<li>The basic requirements of the system must be understood by software engineer.</li>
						<li>All requirements are well documented and discussed further with the customer for reviewing.</li>
					</ul>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h2>Phase 2: System Design</h2>
					<img height="400" src="images/phase2.png">
				</section>	

				<section>
					<h2>Phase 2: System Design</h2>
					<ul>
						<li>Requirement specifications from Phase 1 are studied.</li>
						<li>Customer requirements are broken down into logical modules.</li>
							<ul>
								<li>Helps in specifying hardware and system requirements</li>
								<li>Helps in defining overall system architecture</li>
							</ul>
						<li>Relationship between the various logical modules is established.</li>
						<ul>
							<li>Algorithms, diagrams, and functions are decided/developed</li>
							<li>Engineering units are placed (i.e. modules, programs, etc.)</li>
						</ul>
					</ul>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h2>Phase 2: Con't</h2>
					<ul>
						<li>Requirements are translated so coding can be done effectively and efficiently.</li>
						<li>Designing needs to be documented for further use.</li>
						<li>This phase lays a fundamental for actual programming and implementation.</li>
						<li>Create High Level Design Document (HLD) and Low Level Design Document (LLD)</li>
					</ul>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h2>Phase 3: Implementation</h2>
					<img height="400" src="images/phase3.png">
				</section>	

				<section>
					<h2>Phase 3: Implementation</h2>
					<ul>
						<li>With inputs from Phase 2, the system is first developed in units.</li>
						<ul>
							<li>Software is divided into small modules for coding rather than coding the whole software.</li>
							<li>Source code is written.</li>
						</ul>
						<li>Design is translated into machine-readable format.</li>
						<li>Programs are created in this phase.</li>
						<li>Unit Testing: Each unit is developed and tested for its functionality.</li>
					</ul>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h2>Phase 4: Testing</h2>
					<img height="400" src="images/phase4.jpg">
				</section>	

				<section>
					<h2>Phase 4: Testing</h2>
					<ul>
						<li>Units developed in the Phase 3 are integrated into a system after testing each individual unit.</li>
						<ul>
							<li>Ensure error-free by testing and fully meeting the requirements outlined in Phase 1.</li>
						</ul>
						<li>Post integration the entire system is tested for any faults and failures.</li>
						<li>Testing is done in two parts:</li>
						<ol>
							<li>Hardware</li>
							<li>Software</li>
						</ol>
					</ul>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h2>Phase 4: Con't</h2>
					<ul>
						<li>Whole design and its construction is put under a test to check its functionality.</li>
						<ul>
							<li>Any errors will surface at this point of the process</li>
						</ul>
						<li>Materials produced in this phase:</li>
						<ul>
							<li>Test cases</li>
							<li>Test reports</li>
							<li>Defect reports</li>
							<li>Updated matrices</li>
						</ul>
					</ul>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h2>Phase 5: Deployment</h2>
					<img height="400" src="images/phase5.png">
				</section>	

				<section>
					<h2>Phase 5: Deployment</h2>
					<ul>
						<li>Once the functional and non-functional testing is done, the product is deployed in the customer environment or released into the market.</li>
						<li>In order to deploy the system the engineers need to make sure:</li>
						<ul>
							<li>Deploy the application in the respective environment.</li>
							<li>That there are no severe defects open.</li>
							<li>Make sure that the test exit criteria are met.</li>
							<li>Perform a sanity check in the environment after the application is deployed to ensure the application does not break.</li>
						</ul>
					<li>The User Manual is also produced at this time.</li>
					</ul>
				</section>
				
				<section>
					<h2>Phase 6: Maintenance</h2>
					<img height="400" src="images/phase6.jpg">
				</section>	

				<section>
					<h2>Phase 6: Maintenance</h2>
					<ul>
						<li>Software development team undertakes routine maintenance activities by visiting the client site.</li>
						<li>If enhancements or changes are needed, the software process has to be followed all over again.</li>
						<ul>
							<li>How issues can be fixed</li>
							<ul>
								<li>Patches are released to fix issues</li>
								<li>Better versions are released to enhance the product</li>
							</ul>
						</ul>
					</ul>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h2>Phase 6: Con't</h2>
					<ul>
						<li>This is usually the longest stage of the software.</li>
						<li>Software is updated to:</li>
						<ol>
							<li>Meet the changing customer needs</li>
							<li>Adapted to accommodate changes in the external environment</li>
							<li>Correct errors</li>
							<li>Enhance the efficiency of the software</li>
						</ol>
					</ul>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h2>Advantages of Waterfall</h2>
					<ul>
						<li>Easy to understand and use.</li>
						<li>Allows for departmentalization and control.</li>
						<li>The fulfillment of one phase is needed before proceeding to the next.</li>
						<ul>
							<li>Each phase has specific deliverables and review process.</li>
							<li>Design errors are captured before any software is written, saving time during the implementation phase.</li>
						</ul>
					</ul>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h2>Advantages Con't</h2>
					<ul>
						<li>Each phase of development proceeds in a strict order.</li>
							<ul>
								<li>Phases are processed and completed one at a time.</li>
							</ul>
						<li>Works well for smaller projects where requirements, budget and scope are very well understood.</li>
						<li>Easy to arrange tasks.</li>
						<li>Process and results are well documented.</li>
					</ul>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h2>Disadvantages of Waterfall</h2>
					<ul>
						<li>Requirement analysis is done initially.</li>
						<ul>
							<li>Sometimes it is not possible to state the entire requirement at the beginning.</li>
							<li>There are high amounts of risk and uncertainty.</li>
						</ul>
						<li>Customer can see working model only at the end.</li>
						<li>Poor model for long, ongoing projects where there is no set timeline.</li>
					</ul>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h2>Disadvantages Con't</h2>
					<ul>
						<li>Not possible to backtrack since the phases flow from one to another.</li>
						<ul>
							<li>Does not allow much for reflection or revision.</li>
							<li>Once in the testing phase, it is very difficult to go back and change something.</li>
						</ul>
						<li>Not a good model for complex projects.</li>
						<ul>
							<li>Not good for project where requirements are at high risk of changing.</li>
						</ul>
					</ul>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h2>Disadvantage: Silos</h2>
					<ul>
						<li>An oft-cited disadvantage is the "silo" effect, when large companies tend to create departments for each of the phases</li>
						<li>The requirements specification phase is done by business analysts, design by architects, implementation by developers, etc.</li>
						<li>However, each of the department works in isolation from each other and are "silo-ed"</li>
							<ul>
								<li>There is limited availibility for the departments to support one another after the work is passed along, which prevents team cohesion.</li>
							</ul>
					</ul>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h2>Silos Con't</h2>
					<ul>
						<li>Common result of having phases and “silos” is increase in management and documentation effort. </li>
							<ul>
								<li>Since team communication is reduced as the result of phases and silos, it needs to be compensated with the increase in documentation.</li>
							</ul>
						<li>It is not uncommon that medium to big projects spend one third or even half of the budget in documentation and management.</li>	
					</ul>
				</section>


				<section>
					<h2>Example of Waterfall Model Used: 
						<br>Product Development – Developing a Customer Address Book</h2>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h2>Product Requirements</h2>
					<ul>
						<li>Product manager creates requirement documents that include the following requirements (in order of priority).</li>
							<ul>
								<li>User should be able to create new contacts.</li>
								<li>User should be able to view their contacts.</li>
								<li>User should be able to import contacts from other programs.</li>
								<li>User should be able to email their contacts from the address book.</li>
								<li>User should be able to add pictures to represent their contacts.</li>
							</ul>
					</ul>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h2>Product Requirements Con't</h2>
						<ul>
							<li>These requirement documents will include details requirements, user scenarios and potential layouts for the functionality.</li>
							<li>Timeframe: 2 weeks</li>
						</ul>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h2>Analysis</h2>
					<ul>
						<li>Engineering team takes these requirements and analyzes them, asking questions as needed.</li>
						<li>Product manager updates the documents, as questions are resolved.</li>
						<li>Timeframe: 1 week</li>
					</ul>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h2>Design</h2>
					<ul>
						<li>Engineering team creates a design for functionality, including database design, mock-ups and workflows</li>
						<li>Timeframe: 3 weeks</li>
					</ul>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h2>Implementation</h2>
					<ul>
						<li>Engineering team develops functionality and prepares it for testing</li>
						<li>Timeframe: 1 week</li>
					</ul>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h2>Software Product Testing</h2>
					<ul>
						<li>Product team tests the entire functionality.</li>
						<li>Timeframe: 2 weeks</li>
					</ul>
				</section>	

				<section>
					<h2>Deployment</h2>
					<ul>
						<li>Team delivers the product to the client</li>
						<li>Timeframe: 1 week</li>
					</ul>
				</section>	

				<section>
					<h2>Maintenance</h2>
					<ul>
						<li>Product team checks in with client, makes appropriate and necessary changes and fixes, and helps keep the program running</li>
						<li>Timeframe: Indefinite</li>
						<li><strong><font color="red">Note: If any changes to the design occurs during this workflow, the project would have to return to the second or third phase and restart the process.</font></strong></li>
					</ul>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h2>Example of Waterfall Method Flaws</h2>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h2>Product Phase</h2>
					<ul>
						<li>Product Phase: Create an internal instant messaging system </li>
						<li>Product Requirements document created by product manager with client:</li>
							<ul>
								<li>Users should be able to send, receive, and reply to messages to other users within the organization</li>
								<li>Users should be able to see past messages </li>
								<li>Users should be able to see if other users are available</li>
								<li>Users can have one of three set profile pictures</li>
							</ul>
						<li>Requirement documents will include detailed requirements, user and person scenarios and potential layouts for function.</li>
					</ul>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h2>Analysis Phase</h2>
					<ul>
						<li>Analysis: Engineering team takes the requirements from the product team and analyzes them, breaking the documents into sections.</li>
						<li>Asking questions as needed. Product manager updates document.</li>
					</ul>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h2>Design Phase</h2>
					<ul>
						<li>Design: Engineering team then creates mock-up with both function and database design and workflows.</li>

					</ul>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h2>Implementation Phase</h2>
					<ul>
						<li>Implementation: The system is developed in units by the engineering team.</li>
						<li>Each unit is individually created and tested for functionality during Unit Testing.</li>
						<li>Source code is being written.</li>
					</ul>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h2>Integration and Testing Phase</h2>
					<ul>
						<li>Integration and Testing: All units are integrated and the entire system is tested for faults and failures.</li>
						<li>Entire design and construction is put to test:</li>
						<ul>
							<li>Unit testing: Passes</li>
							<li>System testing: Fails</li>
							<li>Acceptence testing: Fails</li>
						</ul>
						<li>Faults have been noticed in 2 units but the errors have not been located. The lead engineer for one of the units has changed companies so others are scrambling to read and fix the code.<font color="red"> Pushes timeframe back by 2 weeks.</font></li>
					</ul>
				</section>

				<section>
					<ul>
						<li>Additionally: The client decided they want avatars with editable features for profile pictures. They want to be able to change gender, race, hair and eye color, and add or remove glasses.<font color="red"> Pushes timeframe back by 3 more weeks.</font></li>
					</ul>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h2>Integration and Testing (II)</h2>
					<ul>
						<li>The avatar profile picture unit was created too quickly and has a series of errors.</li>
						<li>The client deems the design "clunky" and wants to alter the look of the GUI.</li>
						<li>Also, the client needs it to be compatible with iPads.</li>
						<li><font color="red">Pushes timeframe back by 4 weeks.</font></li>
						<li>Client decides they don't want avatar profile pictures, request that users can update a photo from their desktop.</li>
						<li>Another fault is located.</li>
						<li><font color="red">Timeframe goes back another 3 weeks.</font></li>
					</ul>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h2>Deployment of the System Phase</h2>
					<ul>
						<li>Deployment: Finally the functional and nonfunctional tests are passed.</li>
						<li>The product is deployed to the customer environment.</li>
					</ul>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h2>Maintenance Phase</h2>
					<ul>
						<li>Maintenance Phase: Engineers must begin to fix the bugs that users have discovered. </li>
						<li><font color="red">Additionally, the users have requested that the profile pictures as circles not squares, and can they be animated .gifs?</font></li>
					</ul>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h2>Importance to SE</h2>
					<ul>
						<li>The waterfall method offers numerous advantages for software developers.</li>
						<ul>
							<li>Staged development cycle enforces discipline.</li>
							<li>The developer and client can identify the progress of the project.</li>
							<li>Emphasis on requirements and design before coding.</li>
							<ul>
								<li>Ensure minimal wastage of time and effort.</li>
								<li>Reduce risk of customer expectations not being met.</li>
								<li>Getting the requirements and design out of the way first also improves quality.</li>
							</ul>
							<li>Can catch and correct flaws at the design stage rather at the testing stage.</li>
						</ul>
					</ul>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h2>Importance to Software Engineering Con't</h2>
					<ul>
						<li>Project management team spends a lot of time before the project beings trying to understand, document and plan everything that needs to be included.</li>
						<ul>
							<li>Client meetings, interviews, surveys and all types of information gathering goes into the front end so sketches or mocks up of workflow can be produced and approved by the customer.</li>
						</ul>
					</ul>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h2>Importance to Software Engineering Con't</h2>
					<ul>
						<li>Software engineering is about models.</li>
						<ul>
							<li>A program is a model.</li>
							<li>Even at the assembly level, programming is constructing a model.</li>
							<li>Modeling is the way humans deal with complexity.</li>
							<li>Modeling helps humans reduce and understand the project.</li>
						</ul>
						<li>Domain capturing is one of the hardest part of the engineering process.</li>
						<ul>
							<li>To understand it, models are needed.</li>
						</ul>

				<section>
					<h2>Winston Royce Article Con't</h2>
					<ul>
						<li>Royce pictured the waterfall model with the following 7 steps:</li>
						<ol>
							<li>System Requirements</li>
							<li>Software Requirements</li>
							<li>Analysis</li>
							<li>Program Design</li>
							<li>Coding</li>
							<li>Testing</li>
							<li>Operation</li>
						</ol>
						<li>Models without iteration is "risky and invites failure"</li>
						<ul>
							<li>Alternatively, Royce proposed a more incremental development where every next step links back to the step before.</li>

				</section>

				<section>
					<h2>Sashimi Model</h2>
					<ul>
						<li>The sashimi model was originated by Peter DeGrace.</li>
						<li>It got its name because it features overlapping phases, like the overlapping fish of Japanese sashimi</li>

					<h2>Sashimi Model Con't</h2>
					<ul>
						<li>Similar to the waterfall, except that the phases overlap to show that requirements cannot be completed until the architecture is <u>at least partially explored.</u></li>
						<ul>
							<li>One can return to the previous step if desired.</li>
						</ul>
						<li>Another important feature of the sashimi model is the different treatment of the documentation.</li>
						<ul>
							<li>The model treats the documentation as unified documents</li>
							<li>This results in a significant reduction in the documentation volume.</li>

					<h2>Aorta Lifecycle Model</h2>
					<ul>
						<li>The aorta lifecycle model relies a lot on the feedback which comes from other phases before progressing onto the next.</li>
						<ul>
							<li>The model follows the waterfall model, but after each cycle is a feedback to the customer.</li>
						</ul>
						<li>There are 9 steps to the aorta lifecycle model with the concrete work comprising of 5 essential phases.</li>

				<section>
					<h2>V Waterfall Model</h2>
					<ul>
						<li>The V Waterfall model relies on a linear software developmental program, which stresses on balanced development more than anything else.</li>
						<li>Just like the waterfall model, the life cycle is a sequential path of execution of process.</li>
						<ul>
							<li>Each phase must be completed before the next phase begins.</li>
						</ul>
						<li>The testing of the product is planned in parallel with a corresponding phase of development.</li>

					<h2>Summary Con't</h2>
					<ul>
						<li>The waterfall model has its advatnages and disadvantages.</li>
						<ul>
							<li>The fulfillment of one phase is needed before proceeding to the next...BUT</li>
							<li>It does not allow much for reflection or revision.</li>
						</ul>
						<li>It is important to Software Engineering by having an emphasis on requirements and design before coding.</li>
							<ul>
								<li>This ensure minimal wastage of time and effort.</li>
							</ul>
					</ul>

					<h2>Summary Con't</h2>
					<ul>
						<li>New models has been created by modifying the waterfall model.</li>
						<ul>
							<li>Sashimi Model</li>
							<li>Aorta Lifecycle Model</li>
							<li>V Waterfall Model</li>
						</ul>
						<li>When it comes to developing software, the waterfall and agile method are the most prominent method.</li>
						<ul>
							<li>If your project changes rapidly, the agile method will be good, BUT</li>
							<li>If you know exactly what you need, the waterfall method will be the best choice.</li>
